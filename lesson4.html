                    Public facing functions can be considered a contract.
                    When you define a function you are establishing a set of desired actions that other functions depend on remaining consistent.
                    If you change a function that is called throughout the application it should maintain its contractual obligations (or else you will need to refactor all the calls made to te function).
                    By establishing a contract the function can be more easily re-used and is a great tool for isolating complexities.

                    Components work like statefull functions and can be designed in a contractual manner.
                    In general components should only concern themselves with rendering the DOM and handling user interactions.
                    If the results of those user interactions extend beyond the component itself then the handling should be done outside the component.
                    This can be done through callbacks associated to the component (onChange, onClick, etc) or by putting an event on a channel.
                    Not only does this keep our components lean but it makes it easier to unit test since our blocks of code are seperated by concerns.

            <h1>Components as Stories</h1>

                    Components (and programming in general) allow the user to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure">"choose your own adventure"</a>.
                    At each event the component updates state and the story progresses.
                    Wherever the user chooses to progress the story should be encapsulated in a method.
                    Wherever the component chooses something to render based on the current story line should also be encapsulated in a method.
                    The alternative to this is to attempt to pack more logic into the "render" method which is harder to test.
                    By delegating functionality to component methods the component contract becomes more obvious and other developers can more quickly understand how the component progresses the story.
